Intro

Hi, my name is Benjamin Feng and this is my game and experiment.

My goal is to develop CARCH as publicly as possible.  The source code will
be readily available on [Github](https://github.com/fengb-tech/carch), and I
plan on regular blog updates and live code streaming.

CARCH will always be a free-to-play game.  In fact, I started this game as a
slight rebellion against the numerous IAP "games".  At some point, I plan on
adding cosmetic purchases (never gameplay purchases!) but for now, I just want
to make an awesome game.

While I may be a seasoned programmer, I am a complete noob at game design and
development.  But I have always liked gaming and wanted to make my own.

If you have any questions or comments, please [contact me](/contact) at any time.
